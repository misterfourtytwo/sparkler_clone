# animate_sparkler
sparkler from https://www.flutterclutter.dev/flutter/tutorials/animate-a-sparkler/2020/846/
with some code change and progress bar addition.

# TODO's
* proper folder structure.
* external sparkler controller.
* optimization draw all sparks in one painter.
* release as a sample pkg.
* probably other similar animations. like match or circular sparkler.
